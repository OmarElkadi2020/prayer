 Yes, there is a clear need to introduce new tests to ensure the app works as expected, especially for critical functionalities and integration points.
  While some existing tests cover basic functionality, several key areas require more comprehensive testing.

  Here are the high-priority areas where new tests would significantly improve the project's robustness:

   1. Service Management (`src/__main__.py`, `src/platform/service.py`):
       * What to test: The installation, uninstallation, enabling, and disabling of the application as a system service across different operating systems
         (mocking OS commands). This is crucial for deployment and auto-startup.
       * Why: Incorrect service setup can lead to the app not running at startup or not being properly removed.

   2. Google Calendar Integration (`src/auth/google_auth.py`, `src/calendar_api/google_calendar.py`):
       * What to test:
           * Authentication Flow: Comprehensive tests for get_google_credentials covering scenarios like no existing token, expired token, forced
             re-authentication, and missing client configuration files.
           * Calendar Operations: Detailed unit tests for GoogleCalendarService methods (get_events, create_event, delete_event) by mocking the Google API
             client.
           * Slot Finding Logic: Extensive unit tests for find_first_available_slot with various calendar event configurations (overlapping events, all-day
              events, events spanning midnight) to ensure it always finds the correct available time.
           * Event Addition Logic: Tests for add_event to verify it correctly uses find_first_available_slot and prevents duplicate events for the same
             prayer.
       * Why: This is a core feature. Bugs here could lead to incorrect prayer times being scheduled, calendar clutter, or authentication failures.

   3. Configuration Management (`src/config/security/__init__.py`, `src/services/config_service.py`):
       * What to test:
           * Loading/Saving: Robust tests for load_config and save_config, including scenarios with missing config files, corrupted JSON, and ensuring data
              integrity.
           * Argument Parsing: Verify that parse_args correctly interprets all command-line arguments and that they are reflected in the application's
             behavior (e.g., dry-run flag, log level).
       * Why: Incorrect configuration handling can lead to unexpected application behavior or data loss.

   4. Unified Action Executor (`src/actions_executor.py`):
       * What to test: Dedicated unit tests for the ActionExecutor to ensure its play_audio and trigger_focus_mode methods behave correctly in both normal
         (publishing events) and dry-run (logging only) modes.
       * Why: This is a central component for triggering actions. Thorough testing ensures consistent behavior across different operational modes.

   5. Audio Playback (`src/shared/audio_player.py`):
       * What to test: Mocked tests for play, wait_for_playback_to_finish, and stop_playback to ensure audio files are played correctly, playback
         completion is signaled, and active processes can be terminated. This should cover platform-specific playback methods.
       * Why: Audio playback is a primary user interaction.

  These new tests would focus on the integration points and complex logic that are critical for the application's correct functioning and reliability in
  a production environment.
