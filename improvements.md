   * Details:
       * This icon would always be visible in the system tray (Windows), menu bar (macOS), or taskbar (Linux).
       * Status Indication: The icon could change to show the app's status (e.g., idle, syncing, error).
       * Core Menu: A right-click on the icon should open a menu with essential actions:
           * Sync Calendar Now
           * Start Focus Mode
           * Settings...
           * Check for Updates...
           * Quit
       * This immediately solves the "invisible app" problem and makes it feel like a professional, trustworthy utility.


  Phase 2: Centralize and Simplify Configuration


   * Action: Build a comprehensive Settings Window.
   * Details:
       * This window would be accessible from the new tray/menu bar icon.
       * It would consolidate all configuration options into one place:
           * Location: City & Country inputs.
           * Prayer Times: Calculation method and Asr school dropdowns.
           * Calendar: A button to (Re)Authenticate with Google, a display showing the currently linked account, and perhaps a dropdown to select a specific
             calendar.
           * Notifications: Checkboxes to enable/disable the adhan sound for each prayer individually. A button to select a custom audio file.
           * General: A toggle to Run on system startup.
