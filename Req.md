Here is the recommended high-level plan:


   1. Use OAuth 2.0 for Authentication: This is the standard, secure method for users to grant your application access to their calendar data without ever sharing
      their passwords with you.
       * Your app will guide the user through a one-time setup to link their Google or Microsoft account.
       * You'll use a library like keyring to securely store the resulting authentication tokens in the user's OS keychain.


   2. Leverage Official Python Client Libraries:
       * For Google Calendar: google-api-python-client
       * For Microsoft 365: msgraph-sdk-python
       * These libraries handle the complexities of API communication, authentication, and data serialization.


   3. Implement the Core Scheduling Logic:
       * On a recurring basis (e.g., hourly or daily), your application will:
          a.  Use the stored tokens to connect to the user's calendar API.
          b.  Fetch existing events for the current day to identify busy times.
          c.  Identify previously created prayer events by your app (you can add a unique ID or metadata when you create them) and delete them to prepare for
  rescheduling.
          d.  For each prayer time, iterate forward in time from the prayer's start, checking against the user's busy slots.
          e.  When the first open slot is found, create a new event via the API.

  Advantages of this Approach:


   * Truly Cross-Platform: Your code is pure Python. It runs identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   * Maximum Stability: You are coding against a well-documented, stable web API, not a flaky, private, local application interface.
   * High Resilience: It's immune to OS updates and changes in the user's choice of local calendar client. As long as they are syncing with Google or Microsoft, it
     will work.
   * Secure and User-Trusted: The OAuth flow is a familiar and trusted standard for users. They remain in full control and can revoke access at any time from their
     account settings.


  This service-level approach directly addresses your goal of a simple, resilient, and stable integration by moving the integration point from the chaotic desktop
  environment to the orderly world of web APIs.
