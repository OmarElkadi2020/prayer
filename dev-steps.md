# Work Plan: Refactoring to an Event-Driven Architecture

This document outlines the development steps to refactor the Prayer Player application from its current architecture to a more decoupled, event-driven design. The goal is to increase modularity, testability, and maintainability.

**Status: Complete**

The refactoring to an event-driven architecture is complete. The application now uses an event bus to decouple its components, as described in `relations.md` and `documentation.md`.
